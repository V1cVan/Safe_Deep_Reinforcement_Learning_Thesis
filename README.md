# Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Thesis
Code snippet of my Deep Reinforcement Learning thesis.

Currently implements Stochastic Policy Gradient (SPG) and Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) agents. 

Future code will be updated to include permutation invariant state representations, convolutional neural (CNN) networks and long short term memory (LSTM) networks. 

Note: Code cannot run as it requires a private C++ backend.
